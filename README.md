# Telegram_Stealer
You can use this Python code, to create .exe file, and use it to steal a Telegram session.
1) You need to install Python (3.8.2) on your PC.
2) Install some code editors (Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text 3)
3) Register some FTP server 
4) Open file with code editor and write your ftp access data (host, login, password). Save it!
5) You need to compile this python code in exe file. I used tool 'auto-py-to-exe' (you can search this)
6) When you create an .exe file, send this file to your victim. Upon launching this file, you will get 2 .zip files (tdata.zip and tdata1.zip or tdata2.zip) on your FTP server.
7) Download Telegram Portable.
8) Launch it, telegram will create folder "tdata" - open it. Open folder "D877F783D5D3EF8C" and replace map0 or map1 with respective file from tdata.zip
9) Go back to "tdata" folder and delete file "D877F783D5D3EF8C". Replace it with a similar file from your tdata1.zip or tdata2.zip.
10) Open Telegram Portable - you will now have a stolen session.
